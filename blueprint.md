## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to convey trust and intelligence, reflecting the platform's robust backend capabilities.
- Background color: Light grey (#F0F2F5), a desaturated tone of the primary color, creates a clean and neutral backdrop, focusing user attention on core functionalities.
- Accent color: Vibrant purple (#9C27B0), an analogous hue to the primary color, draws attention to key interactive elements and metrics.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a modern and neutral look.

- Use clear, minimalist icons for functions such as start, stop, log download, etc.
